# Counter Application

This is a simple counter application built using React and the useState hook. It demonstrates basic state management in a React functional component by allowing users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value.

## Usage
The counter has three main functions:
- Increment: Increases the count by 1.
- Decrement: Decreases the count by 1.
- Reset: Resets the count back to 0.
